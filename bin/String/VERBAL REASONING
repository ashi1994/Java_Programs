12  A game of strategy, as currently conceived in game theory, is a situation in which two or more “players” make
choices among available alternatives (moves). The totality of choices determines the outcomes of the game,
and it is assumed that the rank order of preferences for the outcomes is different for different players. Thus the
“interests” of the players are generally in conflict. Whether these interests are diametrically opposed or only
partially opposed depends on the type of game.
Psychologically, most interesting situations arise when the interests of the players are partly coincident and
partly opposed, because then one can postulate not only a conflict among the players but also inner conflicts
within the players. Each is torn between a tendency to cooperate, so as to promote the common interests, and
a tendency to complete, so as to enhance his own individual interests.
Internal conflicts are always psychologically interesting. What we vaguely call “interesting” psychology is in
very great measure the psychology of inner conflict. Inner conflict is also held to be an important component of
serious literature as distinguished from less serious genres. The classical tragedy, as well as the serious novel,
reveals the inner conflict of central figures. The superficial adventure story, on the other hand, depicts only
external conflict; that is, the threats of the person with whom the leader (or viewer) identifies stem in these
stories exclusively from external obstacles and from the adversaries who create them. On the most primitive
level this sort of external conflict is psychologically empty. In the fisticuffs between the protagonists of good
and evil, no psychological problems are involved or, at any rate, none are depicted in juvenile represents of
conflict.
The detective story, the “adult” analogue of a juvenile adventure tale, has at times been described as a
glorification of intellectualized conflict. However, a great deal of the interest in the plots of these stories is
sustained by withholding the unraveling of a solution to a problem. The effort of solving the problem is in itself
not a conflict if the adversary (the unknown criminal) remains passive, like Nature, whose secrets the scientist
supposedly unravels by deduction. If the adversary actively puts obstacles in the detective’s path toward the
solution, there is genuine conflict. But the conflict is psychologically interesting only to the extent that it
contains irrational components such as tactical error on the criminal’s part or the detective’s insight into some
psychological quick of the criminal or something of this sort. Conflict conducted in a perfectly rational manner
is psychologically no more interesting than a standard Western. For example, Tic‐tac‐toe, played perfectly by
both players, is completely devoid of psychological interest. Chess may be psychologically interesting but only to
the extent that it is played not quite rationally. Played completely rationally, chess would not be different from
Tic‐tac‐toe.
In short, a pure conflict of interest (what is called a zero‐sum game) although it offers a wealth of interesting
conceptual problems, is not interesting psychologically, except to the extent that its conduct departs from
rational norms.

A)internal conflicts, rather than external conflicts, form an important component of serious literature as
distinguished from less serious genres.
B)only juveniles or very few “adults” actually experience external conflict, while internal conflict is more
widely prevalent in society.
C)in situations of internal conflict, individuals experience a dilemma in resolving their own preferences for
different outcomes.

2) Which, according to the author, would qualify as interesting psychology?
A) A statistician’s dilemma over choosing the best method to solve an optimization problem.

Calculus is the mathematical study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. It has two major branches, differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves),[1] and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves);[2] these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. Generally, modern calculus is considered to have been developed in the 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering and economics[3] and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot.

Calculus is a part of modern mathematics education. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has historically been called "the calculus of infinitesimals", or "infinitesimal calculus". The word "calculus" comes from Latin (calculus) and refers to a small stone used for counting. More generally, calculus (plural calculi) refers to any method or system of calculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions. Some examples of other well-known calculi are propositional calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.
